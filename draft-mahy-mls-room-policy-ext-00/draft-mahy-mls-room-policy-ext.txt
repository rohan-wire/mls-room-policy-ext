                 draft-mahy-mls-room-policy-ext-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a Message Layer Security (MLS) GroupContext
   extension to include More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)
   group chat (room) policy inside an MLS group.  This allows all users
   in a group to agree on the current policy and make authorization
   decisions accordingly.

1.  Introduction

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) group chat
   framework [I-D.mahy-mimi-group-chat] defines a room policy format.
   This document describes a Message Layer Security (MLS)
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] GroupContext extension that allows all users
   in a group to agree on the current policy and make authorization
   decisions accordingly.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms MLS client, MLS group, GroupContext, Commit, Proposal,
   GroupContextExtensions Proposal, andrequired_capabilities have the
   same meanings as in the MLS protocol [@!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].

3.  Extension Description

   This document specifies a GroupContext MLS extension room_policy of
   type RoomPolicy (defined in Section 8 of [I-D.mahy-mimi-group-chat]).
   The syntax is described using the TLS Presentation Language
   [@!RFC8446].

   RoomPolicy room_policy;

   An MLS client which implements this specification SHOULD include the
   room_policy extension in the extensions field in the GroupContext of
   groups it creates which have an associated room policy.  It includes
   a machine readable description of the room policy sufficient for all
   clients in the group to authorize MLS primitives (like a Commit with
   an Add Proposal).  As new members of the group are added or removed,
   the member which Commits these membership changes is expected to
   maintain the room_policy up-to-date, and consistent with the
   membership of the group by also including an appropriate
   GroupContextExtensions Proposal any time the policy changes.  It also
   allows a client to inspect the room_policy before joining to
   determine if the policies are consistent with its own.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of MLS apply.  The authorization rules
   for the RoomPolicy object are described in detail in
   [I-D.mahy-mimi-group-chat].

   Improper use of the extension in this document could allow the
   creator of an MLS group or the sender of a GroupContextExtensions
   Proposal to maliciously modify or subvert the policies of a group
   chat which could result in viewing private information about the
   participants of the room, loss of confidentiality of the contents of
   the room (after subverting the policies and until the policies are
   corrected), and injecting potentially unwanted messages into the room
   (spam, abuse, phishing, and attempted impersonation).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document proposes registration of a new MLS Extension Type.

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document

5.1.  room_policy MLS Extension Type

   The room_policy MLS Extension Type is used inside GroupContext
   objects.  It contains a RoomPolicy object as defined in Section 8 of
   [I-D.mahy-mimi-group-chat], representing the room policy for the MLS
   group corresponding with the room.

     Template:
     Value: 0x000B
     Name: room_policy
     Message(s): This extension may appear in GroupContext objects
     Recommended: Y
     Reference: RFC XXXX
